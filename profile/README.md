## St. Nohbdy's Cathedral;
it floats on the GPDMCC(.org) docks. 'Tis a strange construct with accordion-like walls, floating on a ship -- oh, nope now a crane has placed it upon a rail station. Off it goes. Somehow, another cathedral has risen from under the water, and the cycle continues. Huh!? There seem to be occult symbols everywhere, and yet crosses too. The hexadecimal is going on here? :3

A lovely choir is often singing -- in fact, many independent chorus(es? i? chororor?)-like songs, beatboxes, steel drums, freestlyes, wow yeh lots of music yet plenty of quiet places, too. A castle of tricks and gizmos and clockwork?

Towers seem to ebb and flow. Bamboo and wooden joinery seem to allow ease of construction, dismantling, and safety is over-the-top by robots & peeps in exo-suits. There is abundant nutrition, clean water, and capsule hotels.

Indigenous languages, systems, and materials are about; ACAB, prison-abolishment, anti-fascism, and more; criticizing the cross as well as the pentacle are happily embraced; the scariest horror-filled Hellscapes are directed at BIGOTRY, with very serious discussions on how to craft and upkeep said hellscapes for bigots, of which many Witches and Monks seem ardently in pursuit of said manifesting, while watching for said individuals.

Nuns and Wizards seem armed and dangerous on the outskirts, training community defense skills until their non-lethal - and ultimately reverse-lethal - techniques, tools, and technologies are up to speed.

Oh, people are changing in and out of outfits, costumes, and survival suits at whim ~ you don't really know who's a magician, engineer, healer, protector... how wonderfully confusing!
Everywhere seems to be a home, a study, a meditation spot, a training zone. Other more secure locations seem to have nudist colonies, an abundance of healthy, consensual sex-positivity, and ways of ensuring these safe spaces aren't infiltrated or wandered into by those who may not pass.
